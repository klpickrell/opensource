Homework 3 submission
Class: CS 5306
Date:  11/05/2007

Contents:

Makefile - generates project from source
matrix.h - some data structures used in the program
matrixthreads.c - the main program
input.txt - convenience file useful for entering from stdin


Compiling:

Compile the project by typing 'make' from the command line.  You should
see output similar to the following:


$ make

gcc -g -c -o matrixthreads.o matrixthreads.c
gcc -g -o matrixthreads -lpthread  matrixthreads.o


It will create the program 'matrixthreads' in the current directory.

Running:

Run the program from the command line like this:

$ ./matrixthreads < input.txt


array 1 is:
[ 1 0 1 ]
[ 2 1 0 ]
[ 2 3 1 ]
array 2 is:
[ 4 2 3 ]
[ 1 7 3 ]
[ 3 2 1 ]
created threads to compute matrix product
computed matrix product array1 * array2:
[ 7 4 4 ]
[ 9 11 9 ]
[ 14 27 16 ]




You will see what the program thinks the input file consisted of and
what the product is.  Read the input.txt for the expected format.
